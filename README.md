## Developing
Clone submodules and dependencies with `make install`.
Compile the coffee scripts with `make coffee`, watch for changes with `make watch_coffee`.
Serve the game locally with `make server`, watch for changes with `make watch_server`.

## Contributing

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with Rakefile (or Makefile), Version, or History. (If you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself -- I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
